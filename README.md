Comprehensive explanation of the workflow I reverse engineered the code attached as an APK file.
1. I changed the duration of the Toat from 1 to Toast.Length_Long
2. 2. Adding a url to strings
3. Editing the url (it was in the middle of hidden gibberish)
4. I added Permission to the Internet
5. I added conditions to make sure that the identity card is exactly 8 characters. otherwise it is impossible to start playing.
 6. I understood from the code that the arrows I choose to click on should be equal respectively to the array {2,0,2,0,2,0,1,0,0}iArr and therefore I should click: up,left,up,left,up,left,right, left, left
